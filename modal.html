		<h2>Congragulations! We have decided to launch you into outerspace!</h2>
		<p>Have you ever wanted to be an astronaut? Hopefully, the answer is yes, because we are going to straight up fling you into outerspace.</p>
		<p>You may be saying to yourself: "But surely I have some choice in the matter"</p>
		<p>The answer is actually no. We hope you like the nickname "Buzz" because that's probably what everyone is going to call for the rest of your life.</p>
		<p>Our representatives will be visiting you much sooner than you might think. In the meantime, please mail your Social Security Card and $1,000 to P.O Box 1514 c/o Corwood Industries, Dallas, Texas, 54326.
