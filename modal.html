		<h2>"Rough day? Cough it out."</h2>
		<h3>A C and T user shares his story</h3>
			<p>I work hard every day. Sometimes things get so tough that I start wondering what the point is. Then I remember that at 5 o'clock, I get to clock out, go to the Chester County Library's Exton branch, and cough my lungs out until closing time.</p>
			<p>I used to be like everybody else. Keeping it in. Then, one day, riding the train to Doylestown, I sat next to a man who simply dominated the quiet car with his great and terrible expectorations. The car shook with each of his mammoth heaves. I knew then that there was no looking back.</p>
			<p>Since then, I've been amazed at the situations I've been able to ruin by barking as wetly as I can. Coughin and Talkin has really emboldened me to explore cough culture and reach out to others like me, all of whom are the greatest people around.</p>

		<h2>Congratulations! We have decided to launch you into outerspace!</h2>
		<p>Have you ever wanted to be an astronaut? Hopefully, the answer is yes, because we are going to straight up fling you into outerspace.</p>
		<p>You may be saying to yourself: "But surely I have some choice in the matter."</p>
		<p>The answer is actually no. We hope you like the nickname "Buzz" because that's probably what everyone is going to call for the rest of your life.</p>
		<p>Our representatives will be visiting you much sooner than you might think. In the meantime, please mail your Social Security Card and $1,000 to P.O Box 1514 c/o Corwood Industries, Dallas, Texas, 54326.
